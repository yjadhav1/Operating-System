Description: After make file runs, './forking heightParam childrenParam' is to be executed to see the desired result. The program prints all the statements mentioned in the Assignment1.
 It doesn't print 'Creating childrenParam child/children at height' for the last nodes, only the parent nodes print it. Just after all the children terminate, the parent process terminates printing 'Terminating at height heightParam'.
